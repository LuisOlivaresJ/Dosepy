![Portada_Dosepy](../assets/Perfiles_1.png)

The easiest way to use Dosepy is through a graphical user interface (GUI). Open a python interpreter (for example opening *Anaconda Prompt* and typing python) and import Dosepy.GUI as follows:

```python
import Dosepy.GUI
```

Dosepy comes pre-loaded with two examples of dose distributions, to allow users interaction with the available tools.
