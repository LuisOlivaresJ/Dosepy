    "\n",
    "It is recommended to establish a baseline value for the scanner's response using one or more optical filters or a uniform object with stable optical density. Subsequently, every time a film is scanned, it is recommended to scan it along with the optical filter. This serves as a quality control measure to identify changes in the scanner's response over time or a possible inadvertent application of automatic image processing by the scanner software. In the previous image, three optical filters used in video cameras on a drone are shown.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is recommended to perform a series of consecutive readings on the optical filter to evaluate the scanner's response to determine the waiting time and the number of scans to perform as a warmup before placing a film. Generally, it is recommended to turn it on 30 minutes in advance and perform 3 to 5 previews before the films to keep the scanner lamp on."

    "\n",
    "It is recommended to label the films (at least a small mark on one corner of the film) to identify and maintain their orientation relative to the scanner bed.\n",

    "### Waiting time after irradiation\n",
    "\n",
    "A waiting time of 16–24 hours is commonly used and should be consistent with the established protocol."
