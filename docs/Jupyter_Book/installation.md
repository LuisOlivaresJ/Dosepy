# Installation

## Linux
The easiest method of installation is by typing in a terminal:
```{code-block}
pip install relative_dose_1d
```
## Windows

Prior to installation, it is necessary to have a python package manager. If you are not familiar with Python packages, it is recommended to use [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
After ANACONDA has been installed, open *Anaconda Prompt*. Once inside the terminal (window with a black background), follow the indication described for Linux (previous paragraph).
