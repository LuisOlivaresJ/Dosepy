def match_resolution(array, array_resolution, target_resolution):
	"""
	Reduces the arrya size so that its new spatial resolution equals a given one. 
	The algorithm averages a number of points given by target_resolution // array_resolution.

	Parameters
	----------

	array : ndarray
		The array that is required to reduce its size.

	array_resolution : float
		Spatial resolution of the array, in millimeters per point.

	target_resolution : float
		Reference spatial resolution, in millimeters per point.
		
	Returns
	-------

	ndarray
		Reduced size array

	Examples
	--------
	**Example 1**

	Let A be an array of (100, 100) with a 0.1 mm/point spatial resolution, and B another 
	array of (10, 10) with a 1 mm/point resolution. To perform an ponit-by-point comparison, we need a
	new (10, 10) representative array of A:

		import numpy as np

		A = np.random.rand(100, 100)	# With an asossiated spatial resolution of 0.1 mm/point.

		new_A = resol.match_resolution(A, 0.1, 1)
	

	**Example 2**

	Let A and B be two arrays of size (2362 x 2362) and (256 x 256), with spatial resolution of 0.08467 mm/point and 0.78125 mm/point, respectively.

	The physical dimension of array A is 200.06 mm
	(2362 points * 0.08467 mm/point = 200.06 mm)
	The spatial dimension of matrix B is 199.99 mm.
	(256 points * 0.78125 mm/point = 199.99 mm)

	To reduce the size of matrix A to be equal to the size of
	matrix B, the match_resolution function is used:

		import Dosepy.tools.resol as resol
		import numpy as np

		A = np.zeros( (2362, 2362) )

		C = resol.match_resolution(A, 0.08467, 0.78125)
		C.shape
		(256, 256)
